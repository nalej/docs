# Welcome to NALEJ®

Welcome to the documentation for the 0.6.0 release of the NALEJ® system. This documentation is structured as follows:

## [Installation](installation/platformer/platformer.md)

Here you can find all about how to install the Nalej platform in your environment. We offer documentation about how to install the platform [with the Platformer tool](installation/platformer/platformer.md), and also a more in-depth explanation on how to proceed when installing the platform [on your own premises](installation/onpremise/prerequisites.md).

------

Then, you choose how to interact with the platform. The two options are: 

- via **web interface** or 
- through the **public API CLI**.

Both have the same structure under them: six major areas of knowledge, which are the main sections of the system.

## **Web Interface**

### [Organization](web/organization/org_user_mgmt.md)

Here you will find all there is to know about to user management, as well as role management and organization information.

### [Infrastructure](web/infrastructure/inventory.md)

Infrastructure management, with the Inventory as its main feature. Dive into this section to know how you can use it to improve management in Nalej.

### [Resources](web/resources/cluster_monitoring.md)

All the information related to cluster monitoring will be available in this section. There is also a tutorial on how to install an application cluster in your system.

### [Devices](web/devices/dev_deploy_mgmt_removal.md)

Everything you need to know about device management and support is in this section.

### [Applications](web/applications/app_deploy_mgmt_removal.md)

This section will have all the documents related to app deployment, management and removal. You will also find what you need to know about application descriptors: what they are, how to create one, and how to use one in the system.

### [Logs](web/logs/unified_logging.md)

Here you can find the detailed explanation of the application logs: where to find them, how to understand them, and how to use them to your advantage.

And finally...

## [Tutorials](tutorials/initiallogin.md)

We also prepared some documents to get you started easily with Nalej. If everything else seems overwhelming, start here!

## [Courses](courses/descriptors101_s1_services.md)

Some skills need a bit of practice. We know that, and that's why we prepared a collection of courses so you'll get familiar with the most common tasks in the platform. The first installment is the [Descriptor Creation Course](courses/descriptors101_s1_services.md), where you will work on the development of an application descriptor in 4 practical sessions.



Have fun!
